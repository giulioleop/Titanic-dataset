PREDICTING THE SURVIVAL OF THE TITANIC PASSENGERS USING RANDOM FOREST AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

The dataset is available on the Kaggle website, already split into train and test sets. However, for the purpose of this report and in order to cover all required tasks, only the training dataset has been used. This allows the integration of a train/test split operation on which the machine learning algorithms have been applied.
